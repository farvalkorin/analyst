# Analyst: Meta

Automated Meta Analysis and Team Strength Analysis

## Key Questions

- Is a team legitimately good? Or do they just play this particular meta well?
- Are there comps that are percieved as good that are overhyped because one team plays them well?

## Goals

1. Collect data about the overall effectiveness of different teams and compositions on different maps
2. Drive a probabilistic graphical model to determine strong teams and strong compositions by map

## Core Principles

Eventually, Computer Vision will allow for the easy automated processing of meta data about the game. With this expanded data, one can use probailistic graphical models to identify the correlations between team strength, composition and maps.
