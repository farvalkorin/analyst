# The Intro

This post is for the [Amateur Overwatch Analyst Competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/8mqsdd/amateur_overwatch_coaching_and_analysis_contest/).

The prompt is as follows:

> Take a look at the Dallas Fuel's defense and create a sample analysis piece that you could present to the Houston Outlaws (or any other team) in order to explain how the composition functions, how the Dallas Fuel was positioned and why, why the composition is strong on Hanamura A, and finally the overall strengths and weakness of the strategy.

# The Game

The Overwatch game in question is a match between the Dallas Fuel and Philadelpha Fusion. In particular, it is looking at Dallas Fuel's defense against the Philadephia Fusion on Hanamura, with a focus on the first point. The recording of the game can be found on the [Overwatch League website](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/match/10466/game/10019) and as a [Twitch video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/265968386). The Fuel defense starts at 5:30 into the game.

As they currently stand, the Fusion have 21 wins and 13 losses overall and in the top 5 teams in the league. The Fuel have 9 wins and 25 losses, a disappointing record for a team that has always had a lot of promise. In previous meetings between the two teams, Philadelphia had won 4-0 twice and 3-1 once. Coming into the match, the Fusion should have been the easy favorites to win; however, there has been a major shift in the meta for the current stage. This meant that, going into the game in particular, Dallas had a chance to catch up to Philadelphia by being ahead of the curve identifying which heros worked well together with the introduction of a new hero, Brigitte. In the game leading up to the contest on Hanamura, Dallas beat Philadelphia in a convincing 3-1 fashion and would go on to win the full match 3-1 as well, dropping the control point map Lijang Tower but ending the match with a win on Watchpoint: Gibraltar.

# Last Time

The last time these two teams met on Hanamura in Stage 2 of the Overwatch League, Philadelphia won 2-1. Their lineup at the time included Neptuno (Lucio), Boombox (Zenyatta), Fragi (Winston), Poko (DVa), Eqo (Genji) and Snillo (Tracer). Dallas played with Custa (Ana), Chipsajen (Zenyatta), Taimou (Winston), Mickie (DVa), Rascal (Genji) and Effect (Tracer).

Philly moved in on the attack by rotating left and diving across the point.
The Philly attack starts in earnest when Fragi kills Chipsajen (Zenyatta). Eqo then kills Rascal (Genji) as he tries to use Dragon Blade, Snillo takes out Custa (Ana) and Eqo kills Taimou (Winston). Rascal had killed Neptuno and Effect kills Poko, but at that point Mickie also dies. Eqo pushes forward to prevent any retake attempt and Philly takes Point A relatively easily.

# This Time

Both teams have new members playing in their Stage 4 matchup. Philly played Neptuno and Boombox on support, with Eqo again on DPS; however, Carpe replaces Snillo and the two tanks were switched out for Sado on main tank and Hotba on off tank. Dallas swapped out their supports for HarryHook and Unkoe, OGE played main tank and Seagull was swapped in for Rascal, with Taimou moving to a DPS role. 

# Hero Matchups and Compositions

## Dallas

### Comp 1: Triple Support with Reinhardt

Dallas starts off by running a triple support composition: HarryHook on Mercy, Unkoe on Zenyatta, Mickie on Brigitte (3rd support or off tank depending on how you look at it), Seagull on DVa and OGE on Reinhardt. Taimou plays Widow.

### Comp 2: Triple Support with Winston

Dallas moves to a triple support composition with Winstown during the third team fight: HarryHook on Mercy, Unkoe on Zenyatta, Mickie on Brigitte (3rd support or off tank depending on how you look at it), Seagull on DVa and OGE on Winston. Taimou plays Widow.

## Philadelphia

### Comp 1: Double Sniper

Philly starts off by running a dive-y double sniper composition: Neptuno on Mercy, Boombox on Zenyatta, Hotba on DVa and Sado on Winston. Carpe plays Widow and Eqo plays Hanzo.

### Comp 2: Dive

Philly moves to a 2-2-2 dive composition after the second team fight: Neptuno on Mercy, Boombox on Zenyatta, Hotba on DVa and Sado on Winston. Carpe plays Tracer and Eqo plays Genji.

## Analysis

The original Dallas composition doesn't have a lot of shield break potential; however, against a dive-y double sniper comp being run by Philly, it has a lot of advantages. For one, Brigitte's shield, Rein's shield and DVa's defense matrix can block a lot of the shots and limit the pick potential; additionally, on Hanamura, Widow and Zenyatta can play away from the two choke points to make it very hard for a dive to reach them, especially with a DVa to pressure the high ground choke. Brigitte is an additional deterent to the Philly tanks; which forces them to play outside her range for the most part. This means that the attack relies on getting picks from one of a couple predictable angles by snipers or otherwise maneuvering around the Dallas frontline in multiple steps to avoid Brigitte and Rein. Supportwise, Mercy and Zenyatta are ok; however, compared to the last meeting of these two teams on Hanamura, the Zenyatta is much more likely to get stranded. Previously, Philly ran a Lucio, which could help the Zenyatta move through the choke if needed. This time, the Zenyatta is stuck as by far the least mobile hero. Ultimates-wise, Philly never had a solid team-wipe ultimate or combo. A Graviton-Dragon Strike might have been an option, but Dallas ended up playing somewhat split

When Philly switched to dive after the second fight, they committed to taking a longer route to try and jump in and pick heros. This works for a moment when Eqo's Genji picks Taimou's Widowmaker; however, Taimou is immediately resurrected. From there, the dive ends up falling apart as Dallas is able to sustain with the help of their defensive ultimates long enough to pick out the Tracer and dive tanks. The last push was shut down primarily by the Brigitte taking out the Genji Blade and DVa's defense matrix shutting out the Pulse Bomb (I think?). This further reinforces the hypothesis that the Dallas defense was set up to be anti-dive, with good cooldown management to shut down the effectiveness of potentially game-changing ults from Philly.

For the most part, I don't think that changing to Winston hampered the effectivness of Dallas's triple support comp; however, it did remove the large blue rectangle blocking damage in the choke in favor of pressure from OGE's Tesla Cannon and mobility.

# Team Fights

## Team Fight 1

On the first attack, Taimou picks off Neptuno, removing Philly's resurrect from the equation. Seagull kills Carpe and pops Hotba out of the DVa mech, ending the first push.

### Fight Analysis

Dallas convincingly wins this fight, largely with the first pick. If Neptuno stays alive longer, he can resurrect Carpe on Widow and may be able to keep Hotba in mech long enough to push in. At the time of the pick on Carpe, Hotba had moved in on DVa but both Winston and Hanzo were still at the choke.

## Team Fight 2

### Ult Economy

Coming into the second team fight, Dallas leads the ultimate economy. Seagull has 83% ult charge and both supports have more than 60% charge after topping up the team and assisting on a kill and the demech. Taimou is about half way to Infrasight. OGE and Mickie are both less than a third of the way to their ultimates. 

Carpe has 50% charge to Widow's Infrasight and both of the Philladelphia supports have 50% ult charge. Eqo and Sado are all below a third of the way to their ultimates. Hotba loses all ult charge to remech.

Leading into the fight, neither team will have ults to initiate; however, Seagull will likely get ult and both support lines may likely to get their defensive ults as well; however, they may or may not get used based on the timing relative to the pace of the fight.

### Summary

The fight starts with a Philly dive through the top window onto HarryHook and Seagull. HarryHook escapes and Seagull backs up. Sado jumps to the point; however, just after this, Seagull uses self destruct and ends up killing Neptuno. Seagull chases Sado down on point and kills the Winston. This leaves Hanzo and Zenyatta outside the choke for Philly and Widow and DVa split inside the choke. Seagull chases down Carpe, and the fight ends when Hotba leaves, this time keeping the DVa mech.

### Analysis

## Team Fight 3

### Ult Economy

Entering the third team fight, Dallas is in a pretty good position. Taimou nearly has Infrasight, HarryHook has Valkyrie and Unkoe has Transcendence. Mickie is 90% of the way to Rally and Seagull is already 40% of the way back to his ult after using at the beginning of the last fight. OGE has been holding the main choke and lags behind at 60% of the way to Earthshatter.

Philly ends up swapping to a 2-2-2 dive comp, with Carpe and Eqo switching to Tracer and Genji respectively. This resets their ult charge, leaving the team with two support ults. Sado and Hotba are both about 70% of the way to their tank ults. Tracer's ultimate in particular can charge quickly so it may be used in the fight, but only if the fight drags on.

Leading into the fight, Philly doesn't have any offensive ultimates; however, they may chose to engage with Valkyrie. This gives them the option to use Transcendence as a defense against a possible shatter or to protect a resurrect; however, with a Widow in place, it won't prevent a pick by itself. Both Primal Rage and Self-Destruct can be used to stall the point or make space; however, with just under 2 minutes, I'd expect Philly to hold on to these ultimates for a final push.

Dallas no longer has to worry about holding a defensive ult for a Dragon Strike, so they can use Transcendence or Valkyrie to sustain the team during a fight or protect a dive target (potentially themselves). I expect Taimou to use the Infrasight when it comes up because he no longer has to worry about countering an enemy Widow's Infrasight; however, it can also be used later to seek out the enemy team on a later push when their positions aren't yet known. Rally will likely be used leading into a fight to build up team armor.

### Summary

Mickie leads with Rally for Dallas. Philly dives in, again towards Seagull. In the poke and dive, Sado builds Primal and uses it to keep himself alive. Transcendence gets used by Unkoe to save himself from being focused during the Primal Rage, and he moves to heal up his tanks and position near Mickie (Brigitte). This pushes Winston and the Philly supports back outside the main choke. While this is happening, Eqo finds Taimou, but HarryHook immediately resurrects the Widow. Hotba finds OGE and Carpe is killed by Taimou.

HarryHook uses Valkyrie, so the fight is now Dallas minus OGE versus Philly without Carpe where Eqo (Genji) and Neptuno (Mercy) are low health. HarryHook finishes off Neptuno, but Sado finds and kills Unkoe. At this point, OGE swaps to Winston to make it back tot the point faster. Taimou finds a pick on Sado as he tries to jump away and Hotba gets de-meched by Seagull.

### Analysis

## Team Fight 4

### Ult Economy

With 15 seconds left, Dallas has Seagull's Self-Destruct. The next closest ultimate is Rally, which is about 30% away and may come up during the fight.

Philly has Dragon Blade and will have Pulse Bomb. Sado is about 60% of the way to another Primal Rage. Hotba has to remech and shouldn't have his ult during the fight. If Philly can get a pick or two with Pulse Bomb and/or Dragon Blade, they may be able to clean up and secure the point.

### Summary

After the dive, Eqo opens up the fight with his Dragon Blade; however, Mickie finds him almost immediately and shuts him down with a shield bash and whip (with a little help from a Discord Orb). This gives him Rally, which he immediately uses. OGE finds a kill on Neptuno, and the fight is pretty much over at this point. It looks like Carpe's Pulse Bomb got eaten by DVa's matrix (or whiffed?), Mickie picks off the Boombox with another whip, Taimou gets Carpe and Hotba gets de-meched. Sado doesn't make it to Primal and dies trying to get to the point in overtime.
