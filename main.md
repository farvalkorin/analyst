# The Intro

This post is for the [Amateur Overwatch Analyst Competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/8mqsdd/amateur_overwatch_coaching_and_analysis_contest/).

The prompt is as follows:

> Take a look at the Dallas Fuel's defense and create a sample analysis piece that you could present to the Houston Outlaws (or any other team) in order to explain how the composition functions, how the Dallas Fuel was positioned and why, why the composition is strong on Hanamura A, and finally the overall strengths and weakness of the strategy.

# The Game

The Overwatch game in question is a match between the Dallas Fuel and Philadelpha Fusion. In particular, it is looking at Dallas Fuel's defense against the Philadephia Fusion on Hanamura, with a focus on the first point. The recording of the game can be found on the [Overwatch League website](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/match/10466/game/10019) and as a [Twitch video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/265968386).

As they currently stand, the Fusion have 21 wins and 13 losses overall and in the top 5 teams in the league. The Fuel have 9 wins and 25 losses, a disappointing record for a team that has always had a lot of promise. In previous meetings between the two teams, Philadelphia had won 4-0 twice and 3-1 once. Coming into the match, the Fusion should have been the easy favorites to win; however, there has been a major shift in the meta for the current stage. This meant that, going into the game in particular, Dallas had a chance to catch up to Philadelphia by being ahead of the curve identifying which heros worked well together with the introduction of a new hero, Brigitte. In the game leading up to the contest on Hanamura, Dallas beat Philadelphia in a convincing 3-1 fashion and would go on to win the full match 3-1 as well, dropping the control point map Lijang Tower but ending the match with a win on Watchpoint: Gibraltar.
