# The Intro

This post is for the [Amateur Overwatch Analyst Competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/8mqsdd/amateur_overwatch_coaching_and_analysis_contest/).

The prompt is as follows:

> Take a look at the Dallas Fuel's defense and create a sample analysis piece that you could present to the Houston Outlaws (or any other team) in order to explain how the composition functions, how the Dallas Fuel was positioned and why, why the composition is strong on Hanamura A, and finally the overall strengths and weakness of the strategy.

# The Game

The Overwatch game in question is a match between the Dallas Fuel and Philadelpha Fusion. In particular, it is looking at Dallas Fuel's defense against the Philadephia Fusion on Hanamura, with a focus on the first point. The recording of the game can be found on the [Overwatch League website](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/match/10466/game/10019) and as a [Twitch video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/265968386). The Fuel defense starts at 5:30 into the game.

As they currently stand, the Fusion have 21 wins and 13 losses overall and in the top 5 teams in the league. The Fuel have 9 wins and 25 losses, a disappointing record for a team that has always had a lot of promise. In previous meetings between the two teams, Philadelphia had won 4-0 twice and 3-1 once. Coming into the match, the Fusion should have been the easy favorites to win; however, there has been a major shift in the meta for the current stage. This meant that, going into the game in particular, Dallas had a chance to catch up to Philadelphia by being ahead of the curve identifying which heros worked well together with the introduction of a new hero, Brigitte. In the game leading up to the contest on Hanamura, Dallas beat Philadelphia in a convincing 3-1 fashion and would go on to win the full match 3-1 as well, dropping the control point map Lijang Tower but ending the match with a win on Watchpoint: Gibraltar.

# Last Time

The last time these two teams met on Hanamura in Stage 2 of the Overwatch League, Philadelphia won 2-1. Their lineup at the time included Neptuno (Lucio), Boombox (Zenyatta), Fragi (Winston), Poko (DVa), Eqo (Genji) and Snillo (Tracer). Dallas played with Custa (Ana), Chipsajen (Zenyatta), Taimou (Winston), Mickie (DVa), Rascal (Genji) and Effect (Tracer).

Philly moved in on the attack by rotating left and diving across the point.
The Philly attack starts in earnest when Fragi kills Chipsajen (Zenyatta). Eqo then kills Rascal (Genji) as he tries to use Dragon Blade, Snillo takes out Custa (Ana) and Eqo kills Taimou (Winston). Rascal had killed Neptuno and Effect kills Poko, but at that point Mickie also dies. Eqo pushes forward to prevent any retake attempt and Philly takes Point A relatively easily.

# This Time

Both teams have new members playing in their Stage 4 matchup. Philly played Neptuno and Boombox on support, with Eqo again on DPS; however, Carpe replaces Snillo and the two tanks were switched out for Sado on main tank and Hotba on off tank. Dallas swapped out their supports for HarryHook and Unkoe, OGE played main tank and Seagull was swapped in for Rascal, with Taimou moving to a DPS role. 

# Hero Matchups and Compositions

## Dallas

Dallas starts off by running a triple support composition: HarryHook on Mercy, Unkoe on Zenyatta, Mickie on Brigitte (3rd support or off tank depending on how you look at it), Seagull on DVa and OGE on Reinhardt. Taimou plays Widow.

## Philadelphia

Philly starts off by running a dive-y double sniper composition: Neptuno on Mercy, Boombox on Zenyatta, Hotba on DVa and Sado on Winston. Carpe plays Widow and Eqo plays Hanzo.

# Team Fights

## Team Fight 1

On the first attack, Taimou picks off Neptuno, removing Philly's resurrect from the equation. Seagull kills Carpe and pops Hotba out of the DVa mech, ending the first push.

### Fight Analysis

Dallas convincingly wins this fight, largely with the first pick. If Neptuno stays alive longer, he can resurrect Carpe on Widow and may be able to keep Hotba in mech long enough to push in. At the time of the pick on Carpe, Hotba had moved in on DVa but both Winston and Hanzo were still at the choke.

## Team Fight 2

### Ult Economy

Coming into the second team fight, Dallas leads the ultimate economy. Seagull has 83% ult charge and both supports have more than 60% charge after topping up the team and assisting on a kill and the demech. Taimou is about half way to Infrasight. OGE and Mickie are both less than a third of the way to their ultimates. 

Carpe has 50% charge to Widow's Infrasight and both of the Philladelphia supports have 50% ult charge. Eqo and Sado are all below a third of the way to their ultimates. Hotba loses all ult charge to remech.

Leading into the fight, neither team will have ults to initiate; however, Seagull will likely get ult and both support lines may likely to get their defensive ults as well; however, they may or may not get used based on the timing relative to the pace of the fight.

### Fight Summary

The fight starts with a Philly dive through the top window onto HarryHook and Seagull. HarryHook escapes and Seagull backs up. Sado jumps to the point; however, just after this, Seagull uses self destruct and ends up killing Neptuno. Seagull chases Sado down on point and kills the Winston. This leaves Hanzo and Zenyatta outside the choke for Philly and Widow and DVa split inside the choke. Seagull chases down Carpe, and the fight ends when Hotba leaves.
