# Lucio

## Quick Hero Overview

Lucio alternates between healing teammates around him for 16 hp per second and giving them a 30% speed boost in a 12 meter radius. He can also Amp Up his healing to 46 hp per second or give his allies a 70% speedboost for 3 seconds. He can shoot his gun in 4 round bursts and boop back enemies.

## What is Lucio's Role in GOATs Comp?

GOATs functionality is dependent on getting a lot of high health teammates into a battle and allowing them to do lots of relatively unblockable damage to a target. For getting the team in, there is no one better than Lucio with his speed boost. The extra speed enables short range heroes like Reinhardt to get into a range where they can do reliable damage and initiate a fight quickly when the other team is less likely to be able to evade and lengthen the timeline of the fight. On the flip side, Lucio can also speedboost his team out to avoid taking damage from a dive or another brawling composition until the team is ready and extend the fight time to allow the team to regain cooldowns or for a teammate to respawn.

In the end, Lucio's role is to mitigate damage to the team until the last possible second when they have to take damage and, once the team starts taking damage, to extend the damage over time to allow the other healers (usually Moira) to heal over time.

## Why is this Lucio's Role?

Lucio may not be the best healer in the game, but he is by far the best damage mitigator of any of the supports. Most supports mitigate damage to their teammates through healing abilities, so that even if the damage comes in the heroes are still at high enough health for the team to be aggressive; however, this feeds ult charge and burst damage offers opportunities for opponents to momentarily out damage the healers and win the fight. Lucio, on the other hand, "heals" his team by reducing the time they are exposed in 2 respects. In what is traditionally a poke phase when GOATs begins its run at the enemy team, Lucio's speed reduces the maximum possible damage output by the enemy team by reducing the time. Even if the opponent is skilled enough to hit shots, their total damage output is limited (and the shots are often harder when the team is moving faster). In a similar vein, Lucio's speed also decreases the time from when the fight starts to when the melee heroes on his team are able to start doing damage, so the fight should end more quickly. From an defensive point of view, Lucio's speed has the opposite effect. He can keep his team out of melee range and minimize the time to take cover from enemy damage.

Going to the numbers, Lucio's default speed boost offers a health savings of 23%. Against a lower DPS target, this might not mean much, but against a high DPS hero at close range where GOATs fights, 23% can be huge, especially when ultimate economy is considered. Bastion can output up to 450 DPS. Junkrat's Mines do nearly 200 DPS and can do up to 132 DPS in the area around the target, so if you have an entire team clumped together his damage can double or triple. Even using Amped healing against a Bastion reduces his effective DPS to 404 hp per second, which kills the Zarya a second after her bubble goes down without other help. If instead Lucio used un-amped speed boost, over the reduced time to engage, its as if the Bastion was only doing 347 DPS. That's nothing to sneeze at, but its a significant improvement in "healing" without even using a cooldown. If Lucio switches to amped speed, Bastion's effective DPS drops to only 265 DPS, (an effecitve savings of 41% of health). That's much more manageable. It also makes cooldowns such as DVa defense matrix or Reinhardt shield more effective because the team needs them for less time to mitigate damage.

To clarify, when I say effective damage, I'm comparing the healing needed to keep the team at full health for the run from behind cover to being in Reinhardt's range to do damage to a ranged enemy that is continually doing damage, with the conservative assumption that they do close to their maximum damage into a team that is closely clumped together and running relatively directly at a target. Say a team needs to cover a 27 meters to get Rein into DPS range. At normal walking speed (5.5 meters per second) this takes 5 seconds (more precisely 4.91 sec). At 450 DPS, Bastion would do 2210 damage. Using speed boost (30% buff) this takes 3.78 seconds, for a Bastion damage output of 1701 damage. Using Amped speed boost (70% buff) this would take a mere 2.89 seconds (just under the length of the Amp), for a Bastion damage output of 1300 damage.

If you consider a GOATs composition that runs with a DVa, 2.89 seconds versus 5 seconds matters even more. DVa's defense matrix lasts for 2 seconds when fully charged, so the Bastion might only be able to deal 400 damage total in the run up time across 27 meters. Compare that with using defense matrix while closing the gap for 5 seconds, which allows 3 seconds of damage total 1350 damage. Whether you attribute this to DVa's matrix eating 950 more damage or Lucio's speed saving an additional 950 damage, the story is the same. Speed Boost saves lives.

Lucio has additional utility when one considers his boop ability to CC an enemy close combat hero out of range or redirect a Reinhardt charge. He can also heal, but I already covered how for in the key parts of the fight for a brawly team, that doesn't really matter. His Sound Barrier is quite effective at mitigating some ultimates when the team can't escape, especially combined with a key boop (Genji Blade I'm thinking of you). On the other hand, if the whole team can nope the fuck out of there and avoid the damage in the first place, he can mitigate even more damage.

## But Are You Certain Lucio's the Right Hero?

So maybe you don't believe my math about the magical restorative power of speed boost. Who else would you replace Lucio with to complement a GOATs comp with Moira and Brigitte?

If the enemy composition keeps the Lucio, more than half of GOATs damage is ignored until the other team has to contest and objective, but they can take effectively as much time as they'd like. This means that Lucio is more of a necessity for a defensive GOATs than an offensive one, because the offensive team could in theory go squat on point and force the other team to fight them there, but they'd lose the momentum GOATs thrives on. In general, that overrules the other supports, but could they provide enough value to be considered?

### Ana

Ana offers CC (sleep dart) and healing-blocking for the other team, but even with her healing heal-boosting her own healing, she'd have a hard time mitigating as much damage across the team as Lucio can with speedboost. If Ana were to use the healing grenade on her team and combine that with Moira healing of 80 hp per second per target, Moira could in theory heal for 600 hp per second across the team for 4 seconds, and a single target, with Ana's help, could get 260 hp per second, but that still falls short in the face of enemy focused fire. Depending on style, Ana can be a viable support choice with the rest of the GOATs lineup, but likely not in place of Lucio because her damage mitigation isn't high enough.

### Mercy

Mercy's fault in this scenario, in as much as she has one, is that both her damage boost and healing are single target, so they can't really compare against an ability like speed boost, bio-nade or discord orb that can provide value to the whole team at once. She could be a viable swap if you think you could somehow get a resurrect off in the middle of a brawl.

### Zenyatta

Zenyatta's key value is the discord orb, which helps targets die faster. The team gets an extra 30% damage bonus and this translates into about a 23% faster time to kill during the engaged phase in the fight. One player on the team also gets an additional 30 hp per second healing, but that's small beans compared to doing damage to take out the enemy source of damage. In terms of percentage, this comes close to Lucio's default speed, but compared to Amped speed its nothing compared to damage spared during the gap closing phase. On the other hand, if a map is heavily favored towards relatively small exposed areas between cover, the time-savings-as-damage-mitigation may swing towards Zenyatta if the fight is going to be spent twice as long (or more) brawling as opposed to taking an engagement against an enemy composition. This math requires that the other team be in a position where they can be forced to take a fight, otherwise Zenyatta doesn't provide nearly as much value to a team with a Lucio that can maintain spacing as they choose.

## Conclusion

Overall, I think this presents a convincing argument that Lucio is irreplaceable in a GOATs comp that wants to survive long enough to fight into a brawl, even in the face of serious damage output from the enemy team. Be wary and be ready to use your mobility to escape if you see Lucio and his team speed boost towards you.
