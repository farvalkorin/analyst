## What is GOATs?

GOATs comp is a specific flavor of triple support triple tank run as follows: Reinhardt, Zarya, DVa, Brigitte, Lucio, Moira. Here's an [introduction](https://farvalkorin.github.io/analyst/goats/intro) to the composition and its strengths.

## Why is it called GOATs?

A team named GOATs had a run of success using the composition almost exclusively. It's now come to be interchangeable with 3-3 or triple support triple tank, with more varieties being played outside the original set composition. I cover more about the composition in the [introduction](https://farvalkorin.github.io/analyst/goats/intro).

## What is Lucio's role in a GOATs comp?

Speedboost his team into and out of fights. He should never ride the payload, if he's not with the team, the team is sitting ducks sitting in super glue on top in the barrel to body block for the fish that people shoot. You can take my word for it, or you can read the [detailed explanation](https://farvalkorin.github.io/analyst/goats/lucio).
