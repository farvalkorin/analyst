# The Intro

The LA Valiant took down the crosstown rival Gladiators and the season leading NYXL to win the Stage 4 playoffs. What could have happened if the Gladiators had instead chosen to face off against the NYXL in the first round, and the Valiant had met the Dallas Fuel in the playoffs?

The analysis focuses on a mini-reverse sweep on Lijang Tower where the previously undefeated Valiant are taken down. Dallas Fuel turn around a 99-0 loss into a 99-38 win followed by a 99-0 victory to seal the deal.

# The Alternate History: Overwatch Edition

In the most recent stage finals, the LA Valiant defeated the LA Gladiators during a battle for LA. In the other pair, the NYXL defeated the Dallas Fuel. This brought NYXL to the finals against the Valiant, and the Valiant won in 4 games.

What would have happened if the Gladiators had, instead of chosing their obvious rival, chosen to face the NYXL? What about the Dallas Fuel? Would the Valiant have remained champions?

## Alternate Finals Paths

### Battle for LA in the Finals

Of the Gladiators two alternate options, what would have history looked like if the Gladiators instead called out Dallas Fuel, the number 4 seed?

Gladiators vs. Dallas, based on their Stage 4 matchup, would have been a steamroll in the Gladiators favor. They won a convincing 4-0 victory back in Week 1, and while I'm sure Dallas fuel and Aero wouldn't sit on their hands, its hard to come back from a 4-0 defeat.

The other game isn't nearly as alternate history. The Valiant should end up taking down the NYXL, leading to a Gladiators-Valiant fight for LA in the finals. If our nearly not alternate history would be maintained, the Valiant still take it all, but its close (and a better chance at the finals than the Gladiators had the way that they played their options for the stage).

### Valiant Shutdown Early!

How about if Gladiators instead call out NYXL, the number 3 seed? They defeated NYXL 3-2 earlier in the stage on a reverse sweep. The momentum is in their favor here.

The bracket becomes Gladiators-NYXL and Valiant-Dallas. In this chain of events, which I think is more interesting, Dallas likely takes down Valiant, and, given the past history of Gladiators and NYXL this stage, Gladiators take down NYXL. This makes the final a Gladiators versus Dallas matchup, completely reversing the teams that we ended up seeing in the Stage 4 Finals. I think this matchup is more interesting; in particular, it highlights the what-ifs because Dallas took down the Valiant during the stage 3-1. While not as thorough as a 4-0, Dallas clearly has something on the Valiant that the other top teams in the stage couldn't match.

## Valiant vs. Fuel

The Fuel win 3-1, so they were the better team for this matchup. They weren't perfect, and the games were all close (by the score line), so where did Dallas shine? Or, better question, where did the Valiant show a weakness they could hide so well it never again came up in a significant way in the stage?

### King's Row

On King's Row, Dallas nearly finishes the map, but can't quite close it out in OT. They turn around and hold Valiant out on defense. The Valiant captured first point with a minute on the clock, but get held by some good play from Seagull. With almost no time left on the clock in the streets phase, they switch to a Rein-Zarya comp. In the ensuing brawl, OGE goes from a blocked shatter to another one and Dallas holds.

### Horizon Lunar Colony

The Valiant take Horizon 4-3.

### Lijang Tower

For Lijang Tower, the Valiant come in with a perfect record on Lijang Tower in Stage 4, but Dallas end up winning 2-1. On the first point, Dallas loses 99% to 0 on Gardens. Valiant take first control of the point on Control Center; however, Dallas comes back to win 99-38. This trend continues, with Dallas winning 99% to 0 on Night Market.  

### Watchpoint: Gibraltar

On Watchpoint: Gibraltar, Dallas Fuel end up winning 4-3. Compared with the other two games, I think this has less of an opportunity to show where the Valiant were really countered because they do complete the map.

# The Lijang Tower Map(s)

Lijang Tower is made up of 3 maps: Gardens, Control Center, and Night Market.

<!--  TODO(farvalkorin): This is broken because drive. Download and replace. -->

### Gardens

Gardens is the first map played in the series. Gardens is a very open map that is largely circular. This allows for good Widows to have a lot of effect, especially when they take long sightlines. This can also help other heros like Zenyatta. The one caveat to this is that I often see Pharah played here when either the opposing team doesn't run a Widow or when the Pharah can play around the tall central pillar to avoid Widow's sightlines.

This map's circular nature also means that both teams can relatively easily make their way to the point with two viable options, including the "white" path that allows for more cover from Widow sightlines and Pharah rockets. It's not necessarily an easy entrance to the point, but the attackers have the option of taking the fight off the point to control the dining room with the mega health pack on the left side of the map (as drawn in the image) or taking the fight through to the point via white (right of the image with a mini health pack).

### Control Center

Control Center plays the most differently out of the 3 maps, largely because its sightlines are shorter, the chokes are more accessible for the defenders, and the hallways are small enough that they limit mobile heros to some degree. In some ways, the point can be viewed as a circle; however, fights tend to take place in a branching fashion either going down the main hallway to the point or towards the stairs and white room in an extension of the fight taking place in the main room. Another key feature of this map seen in pro play is the ability of the defense to push up to the small choke past the Mars lander and the space capsules.  This can mean that the defenders can take lots of space, severely limit opposing paths, and set themselves up to give space towards the point instead of off it in response to attacking ultimates.

### Night Market

Night Market is the most linear of the three maps in Lijang Tower. Fights tend to happen in either the main courtyard (image left with the lions) or on the point. The square room between the two can some times be involved in either fight, and the corridor to the far left  with a mega health pack can also be used for sightlines onto the lions; however, fights tend to take place either in the courtyard or on point, depending on the attacker's choice. Similar to Control Center, the defenders also have a good choke to push their advantage. There is an obvious alternate path; however, tanks can pursue either in the courtyard or the adjoining room to pressure or easily rotate a small amount in the courtyard so breaking through the frontline remains a must. There is a lot of boop opportunity to the right of the point; however, that outside area sees fights less often.

# Hero Matchups and Compositions

## Valiant

### Gardens: Pharah Widow Dive

The Valiant run dive tanks with Fate on Winston and Space on DVa. They choose to run Soon on Widowmaker and Agilities on Pharah for DPS. Custa and Kariv play Mercy and Zenyatta respectively.

### Control Center: Rein Zarya Pharah

The Valiant run Reinhardt and Zarya. They choose McCree and Pharah as their DPS and stick with Mercy and Zenyatta as their healers.

## Dallas

### Gardens: Pharah Widow Dive

The Fuel run the same composition, with OGE on Winston, Mickie on DVa, AKM on Widowmaker, Seagull on Pharah, HarryHook on Mercy and Unkoe on Zenyatta.

### Control Center: Rein Zarya Junkrat

Dallas runs the same composition as Valiant with one exception: they swap Pharah out for Junkrat. 

## Analysis

### Gardens

As mentioned above in the map discussion, the long sightlines on the map favor a Widowmaker, and the large skybox with a central pillar means that Pharah has a lot of space to work and provide value, even against an enemy Widowmaker. With dive comps that run Pharah and Widowmaker, neither team is really set up to brawl on point. If the tanks and/or supports are on the point, the Pharah and Widow have to expose themselves more to see onto the point and risk sitting alone or choose the worse option to move to point and give up their range. The teams will instead want to control the open spaces with range and then punish exposed targets on the other team. This leads to an advantage for the defensive Pharah and Widowmaker who can use their mobility and range respectively to pressure the other team before they can even reach the point while remaining relatively safe (especially if they have a Mercy pocketing them).

In a mirror comp, neither team starts with an explicit advantage by hero counters.

### Control Center

As mentioned in the map discussion, the length of the sightlines on the map favor McCree who can choose to never play out of his effective range. The plethora of small corridors and angles to bounce grenades also favors Junkrat over Pharah, who really only has the space to play her usual Pharah games outside with pillars to dance around, but similarly restricted sightlines onto the point and down the main corridors. Additionally, the RIP Tire is a better ultimate to combo with the Graviton because it has a better opportunity for picks with its burst damage and Junkrat can use it from relative safety. Reinhardt can shield pretty much every doorway and corridor on the map and, similarly, swing his hammer when supported by teammates. Zarya provides a more favorable ultimate to DVa when there are lots of tight corners; however, if one of the teams were to run a DVa they could shut down the enemy Zarya. Additionally, and perhaps a primary concern, Zarya can gain huge amounts of charge against a spammy, splash damage hero such as Junkrat or Pharah.

In this almost-mirror comp, the teams are level except for the Pharah-Junkrat swap. While Agilities (Valiant Pharah) can play outside the feasible range for Seagull (Dallas Junkrat), he can still get countered by AKM on the Dallas McCree. From an initial analysis point of view, Junkrat is the better hero for this map and Pharah will be harder to derive value. 

# Team Fights

## Gardens

### Team Fight 1

#### Summary

Leading up to the first pick, Dallas appears to be more effective in dealing damage than the Valiant. Dallas's DVa has 10% more charge, Pharah has +10%, and their Zenyatta has 15% more charge than the Valiant's. AKM is behind Soon in ult charge, but he finds the first pick on Soon. Fate gets the kill on HarryHook and Kariv kills Unkoe, taking out the Dallas supports with help from Agilities. Kariv kills AKM, but gets killed by Seagull. Fate then trades in Seagull and Agilities cleans up Mickie on point.

#### Analysis

While Dallas was dealing more damage than the Valiant early in the fight and got the first pick, the Valiant find the key picks to start the fight. Specifically, they take out the Fuel supports early. This is key for both the first fight and the ensuing fights because it cuts out any sustainability the Fuel comp has and puts the Valiant supports ahead in the defensive ult economy.

### Team Fight 2

#### Ult Economy

Custa's healing that sustained the team in the first fight has led him to have a Valkyrie available in the second fight before any other ultimate. The Valiant are also close to Transcendence (72%) and DVa bomb (77%) for the next fight if the team can keep them alive. Dallas Fuel's two closest players are DVa and Widowmaker. Neither ult is necessarily a fight win; however, both can lead to picks that can turn the tide of a fight. Based on the early Valkyrie, the Valiant should win this fight with a single ultimate and be able to keep the team alive long enough to build up more ultimates.

In pick based comps like a Widow plus Pharah with dive follow up, the supports on both sides will have a harder time gaining ult charge on healing, although they can clean up the splash damage. They are also more likely to be focused by the enemy team.

#### Summary

The Fuel enter through White. In practice, both teams build their support ults quickly. This comes from Zenyatta dealing damage and Mercy healing a number of headshots from Soon on beefier targets that are not instakills. Soon plays aggressively, builds Infrasight and uses it almost immediately. The Fuel enter through White and move to fight on point. OGE dives onto the Valiant supports and then uses Primal Rage. Custa and HarryHook both use Valkyrie, Space uses Self-Destruct and Fate uses Primal Rage. Both Zenyattas use Transcendence.

The first pick of the fight comes through when Space and Agilities kill Unkoe on point. Mickie launches his Self-Destruct on point. The tail end of Fate's Primal Rage kills OGE and Seagull uses Rocket Barrage to kill Kariv. Space finds and kills HarryHook. At this point, Dalls are without supports again, this time with Mickie, Seagull and AKM remaining. The Valiant have everyone but Kariv alive, and then resurrect Kariv, giving Mickie a chance to finish off OGE. Mickie exists and the teams reset. The Valiant have 70% point capture.

#### Analysis

### Team Fight 3

#### Ult Economy

The last fight lasted much longer than anticipated and the teams gathered ult charge much quicker, leading to just about every ultimate being used in the fight except Agilities' Rocket Barrage. Dallas Fuel is again behind, with their highest ult charge being Mickie with 28% after killing OGE. The Valiant have Agilities' Barrage, Space is 84% to Self-Destruct and Soon is 74% to Infrasight. Valiant have the advantage in the ultimate economy; however, Barrage by itself is often shut down in high level play unless the Valiant can de-mech Mickie and set Agilities up in a position (by surprise or sightlines) where he can't be killed by some combination of Seagull, AKM and Unkoe who can all kill him outside the effective range of the Barrage.

Valiant should win this with their ultimate economy advantage; however, the fight may come down to which side can keep their supports alive long enough to build a defensive ult and sustain their team first. Based on the first two fights, that ult race slightly favors the Valiant as well.

#### Summary

The Valiant set up in a position that is more rotated to defend White and the point, with Agilities and Soon taking the left angles and Kariv on point watching the bridge side. Agilities finds an opening pick on AKM as he tries to move through White alone, with some help from the returning Fate. The Dallas Mercy, DVa and Pharah all move to the Widow's body to make space for the (successful) Resurrect. In the process, Mickie kills Agilities. The point ticks to 99% before Soon finds and kills AKM. OGE gets low and is also killed by Soon. Agilities uses his Barrage to kill Seagull and Mickie. Kariv kills HarryHook.

#### Analysis

The Barrage ends up sealing the fight, but the deciding factor ended up being that it seemed like the Valiant executed a better fight than the Dallas Fuel. They get the opening pick and soak up a Res in exchange for a mobile hero that can get back to the fight quickly. Soon then picks off two weakened Fuel players and its off to the shooting-gallery races for the Valiant. They essentially have a full team compared with Dallas, who has 3.5 players before the Barrage cuts it down to just two supports in a second, which made for an easy end of fight. The Valiant weren't invulnerable after the Agilities pick (Soon gets hit, Kariv gets very low and OGE gets low during the fight) but the Fuel didn't follow up so Custa was able to heal up their wounded soldiers.

This fight shows the opportunity for more pick-focused comps to suppress support ult charge __with follow up damage__. Through all the picks (including the supports) the Valiant convincingly lead the ult charge race to the potential defensive ultimate (both supports at 80+%) with HarryHook at 60% and Unkoe at 37%. No Dallas Fuel player got ults going into the final fight.

## Control Center

### Team Fight 1

#### Summary

The fight starts out with both teams trying to take space on the point. Agilities and Soon combine for an early pick on Unkoe who moved up aggressively away from his team that was more towards the stairs. Soon then picks of Mickie on Zarya as the point unlocks. Kariv finds AKM and Dallas backs out short a DPS, tank and support.

#### Analysis

This fight was won when Unkoe rotated left directly into the DPS of the Valiant. This allowed for a straightforward pick early. There also appeared to be better communication and awareness because Soon immediately turns and finds Mickie who is pushing up aggressively without much of his team around. AKM, who had positioned behind Mickie, gets picked off when he's left against a McCree and Zenyatta.

### Team Fight 2

#### Ult Economy

HarryHook gained a quick ultimate. His Valkyrie is at 73% charge and should come online for the next fight. Custa is at 50% ult charge and should also reach a matching Valkyrie if there isn't an early pick and the fight sustains longer than the first fight that was relatively swift and in favor of the Valiant. Unkoe, after getting picked early, is at only 20% and he is unlikely to have a Transcendence for the next fight. Kariv should build his Transcendence in the next fight if he doesn't get picked early. Soon will have a deadeye next fight (70%) but AKM likely will not (44%) unless he carries with multiple kills in the coming fight. Seagull (44%) leads Agilities (36%) to the projectile DPS ultimates. Both have the opportunity to build ults in the next fight, but Seagull is more likely both with the lead and Junkrat tends to build RIP Tire faster. At this point, both tank lines are low on ultimate charge.

The Dallas Fuel should come into this fight looking to shutdown Soon and Kariv early. The Deadeye isn't as consistent an ultimate for getting picks in an environment with lots of corners and obstacles, but it is still bad news for hurt or squishy heros. Kariv's Transcendence can carry the fight, especially if they use it as an aggression tool to support the team rushing in to pick off a support, so in some ways, it would be a 300 IQ strat to pick Kariv right after the Valiant use a Ressurect (e.g. to revive Soon). Expect a Valkyrie to sustain the team, with a possible focus on damage-boosting the Junkrat to build RIP Tire faster.

The Valiant should be looking to pick HarryHook early; without HarryHook, Dallas is obviously behind in the available ultimate economy and, without a Ressurect for Dallas, the team is effectively down a player. The Valiant's path to victory in this fight is less complicated and doesn't require ultimates; therefore they should take the fight.

#### Summary

Soon pushes forward and picks off Seagull very early in the fight, forcing the Resurrect out of Dallas early and building Soon's ultimate charge. As Dallas pushes through the door, the Valiant fall back to the exit of the main hallway onto the point. Soon gets caught out and killed by Unkoe at 99% ult charge (Step 1 in the Dallas plan!). Custa finds a way to resurrect Soon, but AKM chunks down Agilities while the supports are faced elsewhere. Mickie and co kill Kariv at 98% ult charge (Step 2 in the Dallas plan, even doing it after the Res), setting Dallas up for a much better fight even before HarryHook would need to use his Valkyrie. AKM lands a Flashbang to stun Fate out of a very aggressive charge and he cleans up the kill with a headshot and help from OGE. AKM then kills Custa with the Rein shield out of the way. Soon suicides in an attempt to kill AKM and Space disengages.

#### Analysis

while it isn't an ultimate advantage, the defending team can push forward to a choke and attempt to force the attackers (in this case Dallas) to use resources or ultimates just to push the opposing team back to the point instead of off the point. The Valiant don't spend long pushed forward, largely to give Agilities more practical angles to spam at Dallas as they take the long march to the point. This positioning doens't work, and Dallas executes their plan that I outlined for them to a T, with the added benefit of killing Agilities in the process of removing Soon and Kariv before they can use their ultimates in the fight. This puts Dallas in the position of cleaning up without using ultimates and leaves them in a much better position than they otherwise would be in leaving this fight, win or not.

### Team Fight 3

#### Ult Economy

Dallas held onto Valkyrie and Deadeye. They are closest to Earthshatter, but are generally close (80+%) to RIP Tire, Transcendence and Graviton. The Valiant have 3 ultimates available (Transcendence, Valkyrie, and Deadeye) but their remaining ultimates are slightly behind Space is at only 65% and Fate is at 73% to Earthshatter.

The teams should have an Earthshatter-Deadeye combo if they can land the Earthshatter; however, both the Earthshatter and the impending Graviton are very dependent on how many people they catch. The Earthshatter is probably worth using even for a single pick on a support or getting two heros. The Graviton should look for more value, or it should wait a fight after the defensive ultimates have been used. 
Dallas is closer to a wipe combo, but if they can win this fight without it and push forward, they have "Press Q twice to win a fight". Dallas should look to use Shatter and Deadeye in the fight and keep HarryHook alive until he can use Valkyrie to sustain the team.

The Valiant have two defensive ultimates and Deadeye available so I'd still say they are in a better position ultimate wise, especially if Fate can come back and block a OGE's Shatter. My prediction for this fight is that it will come down to which side can land a more productive Earthshatter, with a potential surprise fight-win ticket from Seagull's RIP Tire.

#### Summary

Dallas falls back onto the stairs away from the main entrance with AKM flanking to the high platform. Unkoe picks off Soon early, who is immediately Res'd, taking out the Mercy mini-ult for the Valiant early. The pick happened because the Valiant had seen the Fuel rotate to stairs, but Unkoe took a sightline across the point and hit Soon when he was facing up towards the mini pack. At this point, Dallas has stacked up all 6 ultimates and the fight comes down to who can stack ultimates more efficiently, slightly in favor of Dallas who still had their Resurrect.

Dallas chooses to Graviton the tank line of the Valiant, popping both RIP Tire and a flying Deadeye. Soon kills HarryHook (stopping Res and Valkyrie), trading for OGE killing Space (stopping Graviton). Kariv and Unkoe pop Transcendence. Custa uses Valkyrie. Fate and OGE use Earthshatter. OGE uses it as Kariv comes out of Transcendence to secure the kill, but Fate doesn't catch anyone, or at least there isn't any follow up. Mickie kills Soon, canceling High Noon. Thanks to Kariv's Transcendence, Dallas Fuel have all 6 heros while holding onto Valkyrie. The Valiant have Custa, Agilities and Fate alive with Space coming back from spawn, but Fate gets killed by OGE. Custa flies out to Agilities out past the cliff edge of the map after nearly dying to OGE.

#### Analysis

Dallas had and used most of their bank of ultimates, but from an overall fight perspective, won the fight "efficiently" because they were able to hang on to a defensive ultimate. Especially with Soon getting his ult canceled for no value, the Valiant threw in four ultimates into a losing fight, including both of their defensive support ultimates. This "efficiency" derived largely from preventing the Valiant front line from making plays by both wasting Fate's Shatter and killing Space before Graviton could be used. This meant that the team could still frag out even after wasting the Deadeye and RIP Tire for all intents and purposes.

### Team Fight 4

#### Ult Economy

HarryHook has Valkyrie. OGE built back up to 50% ult after his shatter, and AKM is at 40%. Seagull and Mickie are at 30% and Unkoe is at 20% after a late Transcendence. The Valiant have Graviton and Rocket Barrage available, but the rest of the team is below 20% ult charge and likely won't have ultimates for this fight. The Fuel have 63% capture percentage, so there are about 2 more full team fights before the end of the map.

HarryHook is the key factor in this fight. If he can stay alive and keep his team alive during the Graviton, Dallas should win the fight. This can also come down to how many people are caught out in the Graviton itself, where it'll be easier to sustain the team if fewer people are caught. The Valiant are looking to catch the team in a good Graviton and get value out of the Barrage, although I'm skeptical.

#### Summary

The Valiant lead onto the point with a Graviton, but it only catches OGE, so the Graviton-Barrage combo is effectively a solo ult to take down the Reinhardt. This allows the Valiant to take space unopposed on the point; however, the Barrage is stopped early by Unkoe killing Agilities, then Seagull kills Soon and Kariv. Custa resurrects Agilities, but AKM immediately kills Fate and Mickie kills Space when the supports are dead (Kariv) or occupied elsehwere (Custa). In the chaos, HarryHook finds the Res onto OGE during a Valkyrie, Unkoe kills Agilities _again_ and AKM kills Custa completing the team kill.

#### Analysis

The Valiant really lose the fight from the start when they get minimal value out of the Graviton-Barrage combo. They're left with no support ultimates, and really nothing to fight with. They also move onto the point to try and take space, but the Fuel use the circular nature of the area around the point to easily flank the team and make Fate's shield next to useless because they have damage coming in at 180 degree angles. I think that the Valiant would have been better served tanking the Junkrat damage going through one of the smaller corridors and Graving there, becuase it would have been more likely to catch supports (HarryHook in particular). On the other hand, the Fuel played the Graviton very well, staying spread out to the point that no more than two, and probably just one hero would get caught in any particular location.

In hindsight, the Mercy play by Custa is a good example of when the opporuntity cost of Resurrect on a low-hp target is too high. In the time that Custa took to get Agilities back (200 hp), Fate is taken down and Space is killed. Custa was in a position to at least keep Fate alive if not both; however, at the time of the Resurrect, the Dallas Fuel had a great crossfire set up where Mickie and Seagull were behind enemy lines in the Valiant main hallway and Unkoe and AKM firing from more towards the Dallas main hallway. Fate is in a bad position and would have likely died anyway. Again in hindsight, but Custa got caught in a bad position providing non-optimcal value to the team when the Valiant needed him most. I again think they would have been in a better position for the fight if they'd pushed into the Junkrat early instead of letting the Zarya/Junkrat combo get behind them as they pushed onto point.

### Team Fight 5

#### Ult Economy

The Valiant have nothing and very little time to build anything. Dallas will have AKM's Deadeye for the next fight, as well as a RIP Tire and possibly a Shatter if OGE lands Firestrikes. With the end of the Valkyrie, the team moves up to take loads of space up to the Valiant choke, making the retake nearly impossible. Dallas should take this fight easily, especially because they can soak time kiteing back to the point knowing that the Valiant can't punish them. It's the last fight and the Valiant have nothing, so Dallas can essentially press Q when they feel like it to seal the deal.

#### Summary

Soon starts off by taking a long flank through a far entrance on McCree. Dallas kites back to the point and the fight ends up their as the time reaches 99%. Soon gets seen, but he is able to touch and get open shots onto the Dallas supports at the opening of the fight. AKM turns around and finds Soon with Mickie. AKM then lands a couple of body shots to kill Agilities. Seagull pops RIP Tire, which leads to OGE killing Space and Fate. This leaves the Dallas Earthshatter wide open. Custa resurrects Agilities, but dies in the process and no one on Valiant can make it to the point.

#### Analysis

Dallas does a great job soaking time and scouting out the McCree flank to make sure that they know where to focus and don't get surprised by headshots onto their supports. There was never really any question that Dallas would take the fight once Soon got spotted. The RIP Tire and Shatter were just icing; neither got any direct value in the kill feed.

### Map Analysis
<!-- TODO(buckbaskin): Map Analysis/Play Analysis -->

What changed between the two maps? Dive vs. Rein-Zarya comps? Pulling out a Junkrat instead of a Pharah? Agilities got very little value out of the Pharah on the map and got taken out a couple times. What do the Dallas Fuel do differently that the Valiant don't handle? Every team tracks ults and knows who the priority targets are.
