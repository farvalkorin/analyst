# The Intro

The LA Valiant took down the crosstown rival Gladiators and the season leading NYXL to win the Stage 4 playoffs. What could have happened if the Gladiators had instead chosen to face off against the NYXL in the first round, and the Valiant had met the Dallas Fuel in the playoffs?

The analysis focuses on a mini-reverse sweep on Lijang Tower where the previously undefeated Valiant are taken down. Dallas Fuel turn around a 99-0 loss into a 99-38 win followed by a 99-0 victory to seal the deal.

# Alternate History: Overwatch Edition

In the most recent stage finals, the LA Valiant defeated the LA Gladiators during a battle for LA. In the other pair, the NYXL defeated the Dallas Fuel. This brought NYXL to the finals against the Valiant, and the Valiant won in 4 games.

What would have happened if the Gladiators had, instead of chosing their obvious rival, chosen to face the NYXL? What about the Dallas Fuel? Would the Valiant have remained champions?

## Alternate Finals Paths

### Battle for LA in the Finals

Of the Gladiators two alternate options, what would have history looked like if the Gladiators instead called out Dallas Fuel, the number 4 seed?

Gladiators vs. Dallas, based on their Stage 4 matchup, would have been a steamroll in the Gladiators favor. They won a convincing 4-0 victory back in Week 1, and while I'm sure Dallas fuel and Aero wouldn't sit on their hands, its hard to come back from a 4-0 defeat.

The other game isn't nearly as alternate history. The Valiant should end up taking down the NYXL, leading to a Gladiators-Valiant fight for LA in the finals. If our nearly not alternate history would be maintained, the Valiant still take it all, but its close (and a better chance at the finals than the Gladiators had the way that they played their options for the stage).

### Valiant Shutdown Early

How about if Gladiators instead call out NYXL, the number 3 seed? They defeated NYXL 3-2 earlier in the stage on a reverse sweep. The momentum is in their favor here.

The bracket becomes Gladiators-NYXL and Valiant-Dallas. In this chain of events, which I think is more interesting, Dallas likely takes down Valiant, and, given the past history of Gladiators and NYXL this stage, Gladiators take down NYXL. This makes the final a Gladiators versus Dallas matchup, completely reversing the teams that we ended up seeing in the Stage 4 Finals. I think this matchup is more interesting; in particular, it highlights the what-ifs because Dallas took down the Valiant during the stage 3-1. While not as thorough as a 4-0, Dallas clearly has something on the Valiant that the other top teams in the stage couldn't match.

## Valiant vs. Fuel

On King's Row, Dallas nearly finishes the map, but can't quite close it out in OT. They turn around and hold Valiant out on defense. The Valiant captured first point with a minute on the clock, but get held by some good play from Seagull. With almost no time left on the clock in the streets phase, they switch to a Rein-Zarya comp. In the ensuing brawl, OGE goes from a blocked shatter to another one and Dallas holds.

The Valiant take Horizon 4-3.

For Lijang Tower, the Valiant come in with a perfect record on Lijang Tower in Stage 4, but Dallas end up winning 2-1. On the first point, Dallas loses 99% to 0 on Gardens. Valiant take first control of the point on Control Center; however, Dallas comes back to win 99-38. This trend continues, with Dallas winning 99% to 0 on Night Market.  

On Watchpoint: Gibraltar, Dallas Fuel end up winning 4-3. Compared with the other two games, I think this has less of an opportunity to show where the Valiant were really countered because they do complete the map.
