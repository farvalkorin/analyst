# The Intro

The LA Valiant took down the crosstown rival Gladiators and the season leading NYXL to win the Stage 4 playoffs. What could have happened if the Gladiators had instead chosen to face off against the NYXL in the first round, and the Valiant had met the Dallas Fuel in the playoffs?

The analysis focuses on a mini-reverse sweep on Lijang Tower where the previously undefeated Valiant are taken down. Dallas Fuel turn around a 99-0 loss into a 99-38 win followed by a 99-0 victory to seal the deal.

# The Alternate History: Overwatch Edition

In the most recent stage finals, the LA Valiant defeated the LA Gladiators during a battle for LA. In the other pair, the NYXL defeated the Dallas Fuel. This brought NYXL to the finals against the Valiant, and the Valiant won in 4 games.

What would have happened if the Gladiators had, instead of chosing their obvious rival, chosen to face the NYXL? What about the Dallas Fuel? Would the Valiant have remained champions?

## Alternate Finals Paths

### Battle for LA in the Finals

Of the Gladiators two alternate options, what would have history looked like if the Gladiators instead called out Dallas Fuel, the number 4 seed?

Gladiators vs. Dallas, based on their Stage 4 matchup, would have been a steamroll in the Gladiators favor. They won a convincing 4-0 victory back in Week 1, and while I'm sure Dallas fuel and Aero wouldn't sit on their hands, its hard to come back from a 4-0 defeat.

The other game isn't nearly as alternate history. The Valiant should end up taking down the NYXL, leading to a Gladiators-Valiant fight for LA in the finals. If our nearly not alternate history would be maintained, the Valiant still take it all, but its close (and a better chance at the finals than the Gladiators had the way that they played their options for the stage).

### Valiant Shutdown Early!

How about if Gladiators instead call out NYXL, the number 3 seed? They defeated NYXL 3-2 earlier in the stage on a reverse sweep. The momentum is in their favor here.

The bracket becomes Gladiators-NYXL and Valiant-Dallas. In this chain of events, which I think is more interesting, Dallas likely takes down Valiant, and, given the past history of Gladiators and NYXL this stage, Gladiators take down NYXL. This makes the final a Gladiators versus Dallas matchup, completely reversing the teams that we ended up seeing in the Stage 4 Finals. I think this matchup is more interesting; in particular, it highlights the what-ifs because Dallas took down the Valiant during the stage 3-1. While not as thorough as a 4-0, Dallas clearly has something on the Valiant that the other top teams in the stage couldn't match.

## Valiant vs. Fuel

The Fuel win 3-1, so they were the better team for this matchup. They weren't perfect, and the games were all close (by the score line), so where did Dallas shine? Or, better question, where did the Valiant show a weakness they could hide so well it never again came up in a significant way in the stage?

### King's Row

On King's Row, Dallas nearly finishes the map, but can't quite close it out in OT. They turn around and hold Valiant out on defense. The Valiant captured first point with a minute on the clock, but get held by some good play from Seagull. With almost no time left on the clock in the streets phase, they switch to a Rein-Zarya comp. In the ensuing brawl, OGE goes from a blocked shatter to another one and Dallas holds.

### Horizon Lunar Colony

The Valiant take Horizon 4-3.

### Lijang Tower

For Lijang Tower, the Valiant come in with a perfect record on Lijang Tower in Stage 4, but Dallas end up winning 2-1. On the first point, Dallas loses 99% to 0 on Gardens. Valiant take first control of the point on Control Center; however, Dallas comes back to win 99-38. This trend continues, with Dallas winning 99% to 0 on Night Market.  

### Watchpoint: Gibraltar

On Watchpoint: Gibraltar, Dallas Fuel end up winning 4-3. Compared with the other two games, I think this has less of an opportunity to show where the Valiant were really countered because they do complete the map.

# The Lijang Tower Map(s)

Lijang Tower is made up of 3 maps: Gardens, Control Center, and Night Market.

### Gardens

Gardens is the first map played in the series. Gardens is a very open map that is largely circular. This allows for good Widows to have a lot of effect, especially when they take long sightlines. This can also help other heros like Zenyatta. The one caveat to this is that I often see Pharah played here when either the opposing team doesn't run a Widow or when the Pharah can play around the tall central pillar to avoid Widow's sightlines.

This map's circular nature also means that both teams can relatively easily make their way to the point with two viable options, including the "white" path that allows for more cover from Widow sightlines and Pharah rockets. It's not necessarily an easy entrance to the point, but the attackers have the option of taking the fight off the point to control the dining room with the mega health pack on the left side of the map (as drawn in the image) or taking the fight through to the point via white (right of the image with a mini health pack).

### Control Center

Control Center plays the most differently out of the 3 maps, largely because its sightlines are shorter, the chokes are more accessible for the defenders, and the hallways are small enough that they limit mobile heros to some degree. In some ways, the point can be viewed as a circle; however, fights tend to take place in a branching fashion either going down the main hallway to the point or towards the stairs and white room in an extension of the fight taking place in the main room. Another key feature of this map seen in pro play is the ability of the defense to push up to the small choke past the Mars lander and the space capsules.  This can mean that the defenders can take lots of space, severely limit opposing paths, and set themselves up to give space towards the point instead of off it in response to attacking ultimates.

### Night Market

Night Market is the most linear of the three maps in Lijang Tower. Fights tend to happen in either the main courtyard (image left with the lions) or on the point. The square room between the two can some times be involved in either fight, and the corridor to the far left  with a mega health pack can also be used for sightlines onto the lions; however, fights tend to take place either in the courtyard or on point, depending on the attacker's choice. Similar to Control Center, the defenders also have a good choke to push their advantage. There is an obvious alternate path; however, tanks can pursue either in the courtyard or the adjoining room to pressure or easily rotate a small amount in the courtyard so breaking through the frontline remains a must. There is a lot of boop opportunity to the right of the point; however, that outside area sees fights less often.
